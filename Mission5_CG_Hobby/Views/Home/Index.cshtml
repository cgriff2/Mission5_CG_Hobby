    <p>One of my hobbies is trying lots of new things!</p>
    <br />
    <p>
        I get bored easily, so trying new things frequently keeps life interesting and gives me something to look forward to! I also like to work hard to become good at whatever I try, which gives me a wide range of activities to choose from and helps me make friends with all sorts of different people. I don't have a single hobby I'm really good at, instead I'm just "pretty good" at a lot of different things and that's okay!
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Some of the things I like to do (and therefore am pretty good at) include:</p>
    <div style="text-align: left">
        <ul>
            <li>Rock climbing</li>
            <li>Snowboarding</li>
            <li>Grilling steak</li>
            <li>Country swing dancing</li>
            <li>Playing sports like basketball</li>
            <li>Cooking / baking</li>
            <li>Sprinting short distances</li>
            <li>Watching people play sports</li>
            <li>Hiking in the winter</li>
            <li>Dancing and cheerleading</li>
            <li>Painting / drawing</li>
            <li>... You get the idea</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This winter, I have been doing a lot of snowboarding, ice-skating, and hiking with all sorts of friends! </p>
